                  My story begins in Tokyo, Japan.  Being raised by parents who were enthusiasts of a universal language called ‘’Esperanto”, we would travel abroad every summer to attend a “World Esperanto Congress” held in different countries.  My father was the owner of a manufacturing and trading company, and together with his frequent business trips, they would take me overseas whenever possible – ultimately helping to inspire my love of multiculturalism, design, and architecture.

                  Through experiencing different cultures, seeing rich and poor people, happy and unhappy people, I started to wonder who I was, and asked myself what kind of life I wanted to live?

                  After my high school graduation, I moved to California for college.  I settled into a snug apartment in Venice Beach and indulged myself in the unique fusion of beach hippie culture.  It was during my college years that my love for coffee started.  In 1990’s, Starbucks began to expand throughout the country, capturing me with their new coffee culture and serene atmosphere.  I spent lots of my days at the Starbucks in Venice Beach, either talking with friends or studying.
